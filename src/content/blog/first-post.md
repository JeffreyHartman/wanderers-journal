## Setting the Stage

Welcome to my first entry in what I hope will be a series of journal posts chronicling my solo RPG adventures! Lately I've been craving something a bit more deadly than the RPGs I've been playing in group play recently. Sure, dying sucks and all, but when your party is rich enough to carry multiple resseruction scrolls around, it's more of an inconvenience than an end. That's what's drawn me to playing a funnel game - taking a group of ordinary people and throwing them into extraordinary circumstances. This style of play, popularized by Dungeon Crawl Classics, typically starts each player with four expendable characters. By the end, if they're lucky, each player has at least one survivor who can graduate to a full fledged character who can go on to play in a campaign.

For rules, I'm using Cairn as the base system. I've been interested in Cairn for a while, having already stolen some of its rules for a family home game I ran with a heavily home-ruled Knave 1e. For solo play, I prefer something simple and OSR-like in tone, with quick combats - and Cairn looks like it fits the bill perfectly.

## Crafting the Adventure

I really like Word Mill Game's book _The Adventure Crafter_, so I'm going to use that to generate an adventure. I rolled for story elements in order to get an idea for a starting plot. The Adventure Crafter is capable of creating long, multi thread adventures, but for my case I'm only using to build one single inciting incident. For the rest of the adventure I'll be using a mix of Mythic 2e and various other oracle tables to find out what happens. For now though, five rolls gave us these plot elements to work with:

- Character Connection
- Help is offered, for a Price
- Creepy Tone
- Time Limit
- An Object of Unknown Use is Found

This already sparks some ideas. The initial prompt of _Character Connection_ suggests "A Character forms a connection with another character". Deciding I would treat our townsfolk as a collective "character", I needed to generate an NPC for them to deal with. Using Mythic 2e's NPC tables, I rolled these traits:

- Identity: Prisoner Fighter
- Description: Sophisticated Confident
- Appearance: Striking Brutish
- Background: Seclusion Service
- Personality: Interesting Bold
- Motivation: Pursue Art
- Skills: Transform Beginner
- Trait: Healthy Social


I was hoping this NPC would be something malevolent, a threat to the village to kick things off. I was having trouble figuring out what exactly this entity was though using these traits. After pondering this, what finally emerged was not one character, but two entities that would combine with our plot points and shape our story...

## The Tale Unfolds

_The harvest moon hangs low over the quiet village of Thornhaven, casting long shadows across the fields. Ten days ago, young Marta discovered the obsidian mirror while digging up turnips. A thing of black glass and twisting metal, the mirror seems to ripple like water in the moonlight. That same evening, a half-dead man stumbled from the woods, babbling about "the artist" and "twisted transformations"._

_Now, villagers are disappearing. Each morning reveals a new horror - neighbors and loved ones twisted into impossible sculptures of flesh and stone, faces frozen in expressions of pain and terror. The stranger, now recovered enough to communicate clearly, tells the villagers he was a prisoner in another plane of existence beyond the mirror. Unearthing it allowed him to escape from his eternal torment, but has also allowed "The Sculptor", a terrible and twisted being who ruled over this other plane, to run amok among the town every night, gathering victims for his bizarre and macabre works of "art". He knows how to seal the portal, but requires The Sculptor's Lens, the crystal focus through which that terrible being channels its transformative powers. He can open the portal and keep it open long enough for someone to go through and retrieve the Lens, but must remain on this side to keep up the ritual that keeps it open. He can only do so until nightfall, so time is limited._

_Fifteen volunteers gather to go through the portal, clutching farming tools and family heirlooms as weapons. The Stranger prepares his ritual, and warns them that without the Lens, everyone in Thornhaven will eventually become part of The Sculptor's eternal gallery._

## Our Unlikely Heroes

Fifteen brave volunteers step forward, each bringing their own skills and stories to this desperate mission. I randomly generated stats, traits, and inventory for all of them, using the funnel house-rules found on [the Cairn website](https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/third-party/funnel-rules/) . I rerolled repeat backgrounds to get a good mix (except for the Dunswallow blacksmiths, the coincidence of rolling same surname and background was too good to not go with). For now I'm just going to list their names and background, as I don't expect most of them will survive for very long...

- Yirmeor Glass - Herbalist
- Beatrice Glass - Smuggler
- Cannora Cormick - Performer
- Esme Cormick - Magician
- Triunein Getri - Alchemist
- Orthax Abernathy - Hunter
- Henaine Candlewick - Servant
- Bevan & Wenain Dunswallow - father & son Blacksmiths
- Boroth Dunswallow - Mercenary
- Mannoy Malksmilk - Gambler
- Emrys Thatcher - Butcher
- Griga Burl - Merchant
- Boroth Tolmen - Burglar
- Grova Harkness - Cleric


## What Comes Next

As our volunteers prepare to step through the obsidian mirror, they know only one thing for certain: they have until nightfall to save their village from The Sculptor's twisted plans. Will any survive this journey beyond the mirror? And what horrors await them in that other realm? Next session: Into the mirror we go...
